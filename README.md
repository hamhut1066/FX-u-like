This is The implementation of the Currency Converter that you asked me to implement.

I was asked to write it this weekend, and have done the best I can with my limited time in between my studies.

I hope that this provides an insight into my programming abilities.

I am not fluent in Ruby, but learning every day, and wish to become more so, through joining your company and learning.
